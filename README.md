# WARNING: THIS SCRIPT DOES NOT WORK YET AT ALL
Goal: To make a Lua script that installs and configures both Postfix and dovecot with a Let's Encrypt Certbot certificate

## Requirements
1. This requires that you have a registered domain, sub or otherwise, 
this can be obtained for free from multiple sources including https://noip.com 
A valid certificate can't be issued unless you have a domain.
